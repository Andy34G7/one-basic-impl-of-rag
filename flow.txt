This document is used only to maintain/show the flow of the project.

A RAG can be broken down into steps as follows:-
1. Data ingestion
    a. Extract Data
    b. Chunk Data
    c. Embed data to a vectorDB
2. Retrieval and Generation
    a. Recieve and embed user query
    b. Fetch relevant chunks
    c. Feeding the prompt to the LLM
    d. Output the answer

For the purpose of this project, we will be using:-
1. LlamaParse for extacting data
2. Recursive Character text splitter from langchain for chunking data
3. Jina AI to generate the embeddings
4. pinecone vector db for storing the vector embeddings
5. Gemini models from google (for the purpose of this particular submission)

Since generating and storing vectors will be a one time process (due to storing the vector embeddings in pinecone's cloud), 
it makes sense to split the whole project into 3 parts:-
1. data processing
2. embeddings
3. retrieval+Generation
